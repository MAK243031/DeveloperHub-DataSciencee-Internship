Task 2 Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset

The Boston Housing Dataset

The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The following describes the dataset columns:

CRIM - per capita crime rate by town

ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)


# House Price Prediction - Boston Dataset

## Description
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset, a popular dataset for regression tasks.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about different houses in Boston, including features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to highways. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values and converting categorical variables.
2. **Data Visualization:** Explore the data using visualizations to understand patterns and relationships between features.
3. **Model Fitting:** Train different regression models, such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like R-squared score.
5. **Prediction:** Use the best-performing model to predict house prices on new data.

## Results
The project compares the performance of different regression models and identifies the best-performing model for house price prediction. The results are presented in terms of R-squared score and other relevant metrics.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the models.
4. Use the trained model to predict house prices on new data.
